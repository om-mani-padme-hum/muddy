* Massive, in-game expandable, interactive and dynamic world, with a range of areas, rooms, items, and mobiles
* Advanced mobile scripting capabilities, along with dynamic weather and other periodic events, all customizable
* Races and lineages, each with their unique benefits, deficiencies, and skillsets, again completely customizable

* east
* look
* north
* northeast (ne)
* northwest (nw)
* quit
* save
* south
* southeast (se)
* southwest (sw)
