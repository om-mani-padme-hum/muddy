A Node.js Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) Framework

## Current Status:
* A good amount of basic functionality in place, but still under development.  
* Ability to build onto world while in game partially in place.  
* Web-based builder interface partially in place.
* Basic fighting has now been added!
* Equipment stats coming very soon.

## Planned Track:
* Web-based user interface that can be enabled/disabled for area development and mobile scripting
* Full-fledged fight engine with easy to implement modifiers for powerful, yet easy fight customizability
* Massive, in-game expandable, interactive and dynamic world, with a range of areas, rooms, items, and mobiles
* Random and wide-ranging item rarities and stats, customization on top of that
* Advanced mobile scripting capabilities, along with dynamic weather and other periodic events, all customizable
* Paths and lineages, each with their unique benefits, deficiencies, and skillsets, again completely customizable
