# Muddy v0.5.1 [![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/om-mani-padme-hum/muddy.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/om-mani-padme-hum/muddy) [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.com/om-mani-padme-hum/muddy.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.com/om-mani-padme-hum/muddy)
A Node.js Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) Framework

## Current Status:
A good amount of basic functionality in place, but under development.  Builder features for creating rooms in-world partially in place.  Fighting not yet programmed.  Equipment stats coming very soon.

## Planned Track:
* Web-based user interface that can be enabled/disabled for area development and mobile scripting.
* Full-fledged fight engine with easy to implement modifiers for powerful, yet easy fight customizability
* Massive, in-game expandable, interactive and dynamic world, with a range of areas, rooms, items, and mobiles
* Random and wide-ranging item rarities and stats, customization on top of that
* Advanced mobile scripting capabilities, along with dynamic weather and other periodic events, all customizable
* Races and lineages, each with their unique benefits, deficiencies, and skillsets, again completely customizable
